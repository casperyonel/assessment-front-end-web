		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
			I was born in the Netherlands, but I grew up in the U.S. I was always terrible at school, but great at whatever I was passionate about. I was never passionate about school because it didn't correlate to what I cared about. Then in college I realized that being great at school could correlate to what I cared about in life - getting a good job, making some money, creating things. I then got a 4.0 my first 2 years in college, re-relealized that this has nothing to do with what I enjoy and care about in life. Now I'm back to square one, wiser than ever, but still uncertain about my what I want to do, maybe that's actually what I love to do, exploring the various routes of life. The journey is what it's about, not the destination.
