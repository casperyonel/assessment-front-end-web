        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
            I started my career in investment banking at Citi where I worked with digital and neobanks margers and acquisitions. I've worked on various deals ranging from $200mm - $1bn+. My proejcts have ranged from insurance technology companies to major money center banks and even blockchain mortgage companies. I have acquired a versatile and trasnmittable skillset from crafting pitch books and working on financial models.

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>
            I've always been a geek for business. How money moves, why money moves, and where it moves to are all questions I absolutely love brainstorming about. My early career started in investment banking. This was the right move for me as it kept my options open and gave me a wide-ranging and reputable skillset. However, throughout my time in banking I started to realize that my thirst for business wasn't being satisfied and that I needed to find a more "pure" angle to attack this passion of mine. This made my turn towards an evolving interest of mine since college, startups. Technology has enabled many smaller stage companies to flip entire industries upside down. This type of disruption was unheardof until just 20 - 30 years ago as innovation accelerated exponentially. This trend isn't going to reverse. As a result, I think a carreer that specializes in idea generation, building, and testing out businesses will be endlessly rewarding and is where I intend to at least focus my energy for the first part of my career.  
            More recently, I have transitioned to Devmountain to learn software engineering in their 16-week immersive bootcamp. With this new skillset, I am looking to jump to earlier stage companies and help build from the ground up.
